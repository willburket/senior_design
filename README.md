# 3DWeeds
In this repository, you will find several developments related to weed detection, counting, and volume measurement.

## APP 
1) Development of a mobile application for camera control, video or image data storage, data pre-processing, data structuring to be sent to the cloud once pre-processed.

## HARDWARE
2) Development or adjustment of hardware to take videos/images in the field.

## PROTOCOLS
3) Experimental protocol for the first tests to be carried out in North Carolina, Maryland, and Texas.

## COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS
4) Post-processing of the data, creation of programs for weed counting, biomass measurement, and annotation.
